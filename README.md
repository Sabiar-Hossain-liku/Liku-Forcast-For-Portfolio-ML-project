📈 Stock Forecast MLOps PlatformProject OverviewThis project is a comprehensive Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform for time series forecasting of stock prices. It leverages a modern, serverless stack to automate data ingestion, model training, persistence, and web deployment.The application is built using Python for the forecasting core, Streamlit for an interactive user interface, Supabase for data and state persistence, and a GitHub Actions pipeline for automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to Vercel.🌟 FeaturesReal-time Data Fetching: Fetches historical and up-to-date stock price data (e.g., via yfinance).Time Series Forecasting: Uses advanced Python libraries (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM) to predict future stock prices.Interactive Visualization: Displays historical data, forecast predictions, and confidence intervals using interactive charts (Plotly).Persistent Predictions: Saves predictions and model metadata to a dedicated Supabase PostgreSQL database.Automated Retraining: Uses a scheduled GitHub Action to periodically update and save the trained model/predictions, ensuring the application always provides fresh insights.Responsive Web App: Deployed via Streamlit on Vercel for fast, accessible, and responsive user access.🛠️ Technology StackComponentTechnologyRoleMachine LearningPython, Pandas, NumPyData preprocessing and core logic.Forecasting ModelProphet / Scikit-learn / TensorFlowTime Series prediction model implementation.Frontend/AppStreamlit, PlotlyInteractive web interface and data visualization.Database/BackendSupabase (PostgreSQL, Storage)Persistent data storage, prediction logging, and model artifact storage.CI/CDGitHub ActionsAutomated training schedule (MLOps) and deployment trigger.DeploymentVercelHosting the Streamlit Python application.📐 Architecture and MLOps PipelineThe project follows a decoupled, automated architecture:Source Control: All code lives in this GitHub Repository.Data Persistence: Supabase acts as the centralized data store for historical data, pre-trained model metadata, and user-generated predictions.Model Training (MLOps): A scheduled GitHub Action runs a separate training script (train.py) on a cadence (e.g., daily). This script fetches data, trains the model, and pushes the results/metadata to Supabase.Web App: The Streamlit app (app.py) is hosted on Vercel. It uses the Supabase connection to retrieve the latest predictions and data, ensuring the web app is always displaying up-to-date information without needing to run the ML training inside the web request.Deployment (CD): Any push to the main branch automatically triggers a deployment update on Vercel via the GitHub integration.🚀 Local Setup and RunTo run the Streamlit application locally, follow these steps.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+A Supabase Project (required for API keys)1.
